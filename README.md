This is an example frontend implementation, which uses my [remote input controller server](https://github.com/SEB010105/remote-input-controller-client).

After running it you can access it using `localhost:PORT` (default port: 5000).

Inputs can be sent to the server by either using the keys on the keyboard or by enabling keyboard syncing, via checking the option checkbox, and pressing keys on your keyboard.

>![info]
>Not all keys on the keyboard are supported by the pyautogui backend.
